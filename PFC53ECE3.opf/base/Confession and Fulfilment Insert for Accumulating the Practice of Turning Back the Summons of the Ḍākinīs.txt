by Rigdzin Jikmé Lingpa

From every sacred land and place of power,

From all the cities of ḍākas and ḍākinīs,
pawo khandrö drongkhyer né
Throughout the vast cosmos of Gangchen Tso,
dorjé rinchen pema lé
You ḍākinīs in your huge throng,
bumtrak yangpé khandrö tsok
In families: Vajra, Ratna, Padma and Karma, in your hundreds of thousands—come now to this place!
dir jön nyerchö döyön dang
With these sense offerings and stimulants
tsok kyi khorlö tukdam kang
And with this tsok feast, all your sacred wishes are fulfilled!
tekpa sum dang rigdzin gyi
We confess and heal all impairments and breakages
dom sum damtsik nyamchak shak
In the vows and samayas of the three yānas, and of the vidyādharas!
tenpa gyatso drönmé ché
For this supreme master who resides here,
semchen yong kyi pung dang nyen
This great torch of the ocean-like teaching of Buddha,
di na shyukpé kyechok gi
This protector and friend to every sentient being:
tsé trang barché ying su sol
Dispel all dangers to life and obstacles into space!
pawo khandrö sünkha dok
Turn back the summons of the ḍākas and ḍākinīs!
shyabpé tenpé tashi tsol
Let everything be auspicious for a life that is secure and long!

This practice is to be inserted in place of the confession and fulfilment in the Yumka tsok
when practising a hundred tsok offerings1 of the elaborate practice of Turning Back the Summons.
